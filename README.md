## 1. Overview

The aim of this project to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## 2. Functionalities

### 2.1 Self-built Server

A server is built locally by **Node.js** and **Express** to create API end points for GET and POST requests. This app uses both requests to fetch data from OpenWeather.

### 2.2 Fetching Data from OpenWeather

An OpenWeather API was added to this app. Real data will be added to the UI when you submit correct inputs.

## 3. Dependencies

This project was created with only HTML5, CSS 3 and JavaScript(ES2015/ES6). No extra dependencies were used.
